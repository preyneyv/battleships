# Battleships
This is my version of a classic game called Battleships. The rules are simple.

1. Each person arranges their ships in any way they want in the grid, without revealing their locations to the other player.
2. Players take turns shooting missiles in an attempt to hit the other player's ships
3. The first player to sink his/her opponent's ships wins.

In this case, there is no second player, but rather a bot that randomly arranges ships and fires missiles. The program executable is the [Battleships.jar](https://github.com/preyneyv/battleships/raw/master/Battleships.jar) file. The code is also available in the [src/](https://github.com/preyneyv/battleships/tree/master/src) folder.

The program is a command-line application. To run it, first [download the JAR file](https://github.com/preyneyv/battleships/raw/master/Battleships.jar). Then open a command prompt or terminal and type in `java -jar path/to/Battleships.jar`.

Have fun!
